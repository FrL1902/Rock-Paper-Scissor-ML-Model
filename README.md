# Rock-Paper-Scissor-ML-Model
Making an ML model to recognize if image being inputted is rock, paper, or scissor


Hi there!

I made a simple ML model to recognize whether the inputted image from the user is either rock, paper, or scissor. you know, from the game Rock Paper Scissor

The dataset is used is from this link https://github.com/dicodingacademy/assets/releases/download/release/rockpaperscissors.zip.

The documentations are in the ipynb cells

This is a successful dicoding submission attempt

Although i do wish that i can improve certain areas of the code, such as implementing:
- more than 1 hidden layer
- more picture augmentation
- use optimizer and loss-function

but i guess that's an improvement for the future me to handle. for this dataset, the code is (i think) just ok as it is
